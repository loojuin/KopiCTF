Instructions:
The flag has been encoded into a 2-dimensional pixel array.
Figure out how the encoding was performed, and extract the flag
from the pixel array.

We have also provided a portal for you to put any string of your
choice through the encoding process, so that you can see the result.

Please, this is not a buffer-overflow or command-injection challenge,
so please do not try any of that stuff.
